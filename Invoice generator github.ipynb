    "\n",
    "# 1. From the given path, it takes already preprepared excel file with all spreadsheets and seperates it all into different dataframes, based on what columns needs to be extracted and changing the name of those columns to english ones.\n",
    "# 2. Dataframes are created using regex filtering for each product group based on index sepperation. The product groups are selected from the general category that is actually usefull or at least is used on common basis. Then those product groups are assigned via dictionary for access.\n",
    "# 3. The generator part is responsible for invoice structure generation, based on column inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Probability(num) - is just a simple random probability generator, based on the len(num) input, if the input is 5, it will generatre random       probability -p- for each 5 inputs.\n",
    "    # Product_price_generator(args) - depending on the filter mode that is selected, 'normal' or 'common', first part of the function is               dedicated for probability creation, based on 'normal' or 'common' mode, which are later used for price calculation. when it comes to             common mode, different maps can be used and weight assginment if needed. Once the probabilites, higher and lower price limits are                calculated based on the manual inputs in the UI. These inputs allow to create a price range for which the final price of the invoice             will be generated based on the amount of products are selected. The amount of products that are selected, dirrectly correlate to the             probabilites, that are also used calculate Quantity variable. This varriable helps to calculate total sum - 'Final_sum' variable for each        row of products that are selected.\n",
    "    # Disassembler(dataframe) - simple function that transform dataframe into a dictionary, while also adding 'Index' column.\n",
    "    # Invoice_assembler() and simple_Invoice_assembler() - Main invoice data frame assmebler, where it creates basically all the invoice               strucutre that is in the dataframe format. There are 2 different assembler fucntions becasue 'Invoice_generator' later decides which one         to used, based on what filter is selected, 'common items' or just 'normal' modes. If the common items are selected, Invoice_assembler will       be use, otherwise simple_Invoice_assembler will be used, once normal mode is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Just basic regex filters that are later used to filter out thorugh different assigned groups.\n",
    "# 5. Interface part is responsible for creating main category checkboxes that are observed through Update_items function. It allows further access for deeper filter selection through the collection of observers at the end of the function. This part also stores outputs for the  updaters that are directly related to this function, which observers are observering. Meaning that if one category is selected via Checkbox, it stores the info in Item_checkboxes that allows for other functions to work like updaters, that further branch out into specific filters.\n",
    "# 6. In Filter selection part, seperate Checkboxes are being created to store regix filters that are later being assigned in a dictionary which each corresponding regex filter varriable. Once each filter is assigned, then a the main dictionary - 'Checkbox_dictionary_Filter' is created, that stores information on which dataframes is compatable with which filter, allowing custom filter -manual- assignment, depending if the actuall excel data has data for the propper filter selection. This section also stores custom filter dictionaries that allows to branch off into multilayer filtering, e.g. pipe type.\n",
    "# 7. Next, the custom slider settings are created based on the selected dataframe from the main category. The main takeaway from this section is the first lines of the 'update_max_parts_slider' function, specificly -hasattr(Invoice_filtering, 'last_filtered_df')- part. This part reacts to the last_filtered_df atribute that is created in 'Invoice_filtering' function. Meaning that in that function, it stores custom selected filters in a mask that is later assigned to the selected_df, that is stored with the 'last_filtered_df' attribute. Meaning it creates Bool outcome of True/False. This is important becasuse for the initial 'update_max_parts_slider' function, it determines what is the custom slider max selection. Meaning that if filters are selected, it will change according automaticly, if not, it will basically set to the default selected category max product count (if product group contains 12 rows e.g. the max will be 12, if with filters selected number reduces to 4, max will be 4).  \n",
    "# 8. Stores updaters that allows for further filter selection, once the main categories and sub-groups were selected from the Item_checkboxes. It basically stores updaters that refrence to the Checkbox_dictionary_Filter for the custom filter assignment. Stores the signals that are catched by the observers in the Update_items function, that allows sub-groups to appear and custom filters to be shown from the custom filter boxes.\n",
    "# 9. Once the updaters are created, next VBoxes are created to store the selected filter checkboxes, while 'Invoice_filtering' function applies the selected filters to the dataframe and returns filtered_df, that can be affected my normal filters or 'common' filter method and its sliders.\n",
    "# 10. This part is also responsible mainly for custom slider activity. Basically 'update_group_common_filters' also works in tender with custom sliders, even thou it is put later down the code, as it reacts to what groups are selected and reacts to the amount of groups are selected, allowing to match the slider amount. This section also controls slider settings and how many can there be. Lastly, in this part, filter palcement is controler via HBoxes and VBoxes, assigning them to the normal filters on the left side, and 'common' item filters and its sliders to the 'special filters' side that is on the right.\n",
    "# 11. 'Invoice_generator' is in essence, responsible for price input and calculation. Here the text boxes are stored which can receive gaol amount, upper and lower limtis of the amount. and 'Invoice_generator' raects to the inputs accordingly, in regarnds to which specific products groups it is assigned. Meaning that only the specified groups of dataframes will react to the inputs of these custom price settings.\n",
    "# 12. This part is responsible for client info in the invoice. It has multiple functions. It has a dropdown menu, that allows to select predetermined 'common' clients, that stores all the necessary info like, company name, location, company's code and VAT code. Here you can also manually add custom clients for future preference. If a predetermined client is selected, all the info is already filled in, otherwise 'Empty' option is available, that allows you to custom input the details.\n",
    "# 13. Next up is the excel formating and invoice sheet assembling using 'openpyxl' library. This section also contains word to text converters, that allows to convert final invoice amount into word format that you woudn't need to do it manually. Also this part contains reactive part to the finised 'Invoice' dataframe that is created in 'Invoice_generator' function, that allows to extend invoice cells automaticly, in regards to how many rows there are in the dataframe. Lastly it has the pathway to the invoice export that reacts to the 'File_printer' and print invoice button, alongside the file naming system, that takes into consideration most possible errors.\n",
    "# 14. Lastly the outputs that ties everything together, helps to make the UI and contains main UI buttons and sums up all the functions of the code, for the final outputs.\n",
